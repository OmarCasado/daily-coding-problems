Write a function called countDown($n) that takes a positive integer and prints (using echo) the numbers from $n down to 1, one per line, using recursion.

Example:
countDown(5);

Expected output:
5
4
3
2
1

Requirements:
・Do not use loops (for, while).
・Use recursion to print the numbers.
・The base case must prevent the recursion from going below 1.
