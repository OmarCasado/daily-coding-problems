Write a function in PHP called mostFrequentNumber($numbers) that takes an array of integers and returns the number that appears most frequently.
If there is a tie, return the smallest number among the most frequent ones.

Example:
$input = [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1];
echo mostFrequentNumber($input); // Expected result: 1
